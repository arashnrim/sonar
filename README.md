# sonar

Welcome to the project repository for Sonar's website! This project is part of an assignment required by one of my modules in school.

> **Warning**

> It's likely that, at this point in time, you'll encounter a not found error when you click on any link in this README that points to the repository. This is mainly caused by the fact that the repository is **private**; once the assignment period is nearing its end or has ended, I'll make the repository public.

## About the project

Sonar is a fictitious music streaming service (similar to the likes of [Spotify](https://spotify.com), [Apple Music](https://apple.com/music), and [TIDAL](https://tidal.com)). The idea of creating a website for Sonar came about after creating a small UI design project creating the UI of Sonar on a mobile device.

The following is lifted from the assignment brief, stating what is expected of the project:

> **REQUIREMENTS**
>
> - Build a static front-end responsive website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern web development techniques.
> - Design a front-end web application based on sound design principles and accessibility.
> - Use version control software to maintain and upload code.
> - Test and deploy a front-end web application to GitHub.

This project is written with vanilla web languages (i.e., HTML, CSS, and JavaScript); [index.html](https://github.com/arashnrim/sonar/blob/main/index.html) is the main entry point.

## Wiki and `docs`

Since this project is based on understanding of the code, this repository makes use of the wiki to explain things in further detail where appropriate. Feel free to [head over to the wiki](https://github.com/arashnrim/sonar/wiki) to check details out! If you aren't on GitHub, a copy of the wiki is made in the `docs`folder.
