            Sonar offers accurate lyrics from artists via LyricFind, so you'll
            be able to play your music and sing to it. We're also introducing
            word-by-word-timed lyrics, so you can have a karaoke experience like
            no other.

          <p>
            Artists know their songs best and what every line means. We work
            with Genius and other services to scout for what artists have said
            about their songs and present them to you in an understandable
            manner.

            Sonar uses community-powered translations by Musixmatch and sourced
            internally to provide you with the best translations for the songs
            you listen to. You don't need to copy and paste song lyrics into a
            translator anymore.
