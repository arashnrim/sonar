The design process for the website was not extensive due to time restraints, but sufficient effort was put in to ensure that the final design would be adequate. There is a rough process that was undertaken to plan the design for this website:

1. [Research](#research)
2. [User flows](#user-flows)
3. [Rough wireframe](#rough-wireframe)
4. [Translation to code](#translation-to-code)

## Research

To begin with, research on what a suitable website for a music streaming app would be must be done. The main goal of the website is to advertise the services of the service and encourage users to try it. It is not meant to be the actual platform.

I took a look at the websites for [Apple Music](https://apple.com/music), [TIDAL](https://tidal.com), and [Amazon Music](https://www.amazon.com/music) as references in coming up with the user flows and subsequently the design of the website.

## User flows

After research, it's recommended to come up with user flows or stories that guide the design process from the perspective of the user. As a user coming to the website, what do they expect?

- As a user, I want to know what the service is when I land on the landing site.
  - This means that I need to dedicate the home page primarily to giving a general overview of all the pages throughout the entire website. I plan on having it in the form of sections, and each section pointing to its respective page.
- As a user, I want to learn more about the features the service has.
  - This can be a prominent page on its own, listing all the features together. I plan to make it a separate experiences page.
- As a user, I want to know how much it costs to use the product.
  - This can be a prominent page on its own. I plan to make it a separate pricing page.

## Rough wireframe

A part of the requirements for this assignment is to use [Adobe XD](https://adobe.com/xd) to come up with a rough wireframe. I didn't spend much time on this, as it should be the case, and focused on planning the structure of each page.

My main process when coming up with the structure includes the feasibility to code as well as how well-presented it is for the content. I try to consider how best to display the content and to make each page unique.

## Translation to code

There wasn't much of a process when it came to translating the rough wireframe into code since the wireframe is a low-fidelity prototype. For the most part, I referenced the wireframe (i.e., the rough outline and skeletal structure of the page) and replicated it on the website before filling in with content and styling the website.
