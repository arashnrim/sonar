Welcome to the wiki for the website of Sonar, a ficitious music streaming service!

A preface must be made that Sonar is **an entirely fictitious music streaming service**. It is not a real entity in the real world that acts as a potential competitor against existing music services. The concept of Sonar was made up when I was thinking about how to design a streamlined and minimalistic music streaming app along the likes of Spotify and Apple Music on device, and for a school module assignment this was extended to developing a website for it.

Feel free to explore this wiki however you like. This wiki will generally store content that is otherwise too long to contain, or will make it confusing to read by obfuscating important details. Here's a semi-updated list of what this wiki currently contains:

- `design-process.md` — a look at how I came up with the design of the project, alongside considerations.
- `interesting-encounters.md` — a documentation of some interesting encounters I've had while embarking on this project.
- `page-breakdown.md` — a detailed breakdown of the files used for each page and the design.
- `specifications.md` — an analysis of the design and technical aspects of the website.
